  <div style="width: 100%">

    <div style="float: left; width: 40%" class="transbox">
      <p><span class="blue">Riding dirt bikes</span> - I lived in the desert most of my life and my whole family had motorcycles and we would always go trail riding as a family and most of my friends went ridding as well.</p>

      <p><span class="blue">Snowboarding</span> – The town I lived in was right up against Big Bear mountain and only a 30-minute drive to the two ski resorts. For the last several years I would get a season pass as go riding often.</p>

      <p><span class="blue">Technology</span> – Technology, has always been an interesting topic to me. I attended a small High school growing up but most technology courses were not offered at my school. Now attending Chico State, I can enroll in various technology courses.</p>

      <p><span class="blue">EDM music</span> - I love all music’s but EDM or Electric Dance Music is one of my favorites because of its bass oriented styles of music and I feel that it really moves you. </p>
