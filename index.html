      <p>   I have compiled a brief personal bio written to demonstrate my knowledge on HTML and CSS files. I included some basic facts about myself, personal interests, history in computing and my class development portfolio. Please enjoy.</p>
      <p>   My name is Adam Garcia I am a 22-year-old Tech student attending Chico state. This is my first semester attending Chico state. I recently transferred Spring 2017 semester from Victorville Community College.</p>
      <p>   I used to live in Lucerne Valley which is an eight-hour drive south of Chico. Iâ€™m so far enjoying CSU Chico, the weather is often rainy which is something I am not used to considering I lived in the high desert previously.</p>
